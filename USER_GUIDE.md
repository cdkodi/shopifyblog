### SEO and Content Planning Metrics

The topic creation form includes three important metrics for SEO strategy and content planning. These fields help you make data-driven decisions about which topics to prioritize and how to approach content creation.

#### Priority (1-10)

**Purpose**: Content prioritization for editorial planning and resource allocation.

**How to Use**:
- **High Priority (8-10)**: Urgent topics that should be created immediately
  - Time-sensitive content (seasonal, trending topics)
  - High-converting topics for your business
  - Topics aligned with current marketing campaigns
- **Medium Priority (4-7)**: Standard content pipeline topics
  - Evergreen content that performs consistently
  - Regular blog content to maintain publishing schedule
  - Topics with moderate business impact
- **Low Priority (1-3)**: Future content or experimental topics
  - Nice-to-have content when resources are available
  - Experimental topics to test new audiences
  - Content for long-term SEO strategy

**Dashboard Integration**: Priority scores are displayed as color-coded badges:
- Red (8-10): High priority topics
- Orange (6-7): Medium-high priority
- Yellow (4-5): Medium priority  
- Green (1-3): Low priority

**Filtering**: Use the priority range filters on the dashboard to focus on specific priority levels.

#### Search Volume

**Purpose**: Estimated monthly search volume for the topic's target keywords.

**How to Use**:
- **High Volume (10,000+)**: Topics with significant traffic potential
  - Consider these for SEO-focused content
  - May require more comprehensive, high-quality content
  - Higher potential ROI but possibly more competition
- **Medium Volume (1,000-10,000)**: Sweet spot for most businesses
  - Good balance of opportunity vs. competition
  - Achievable ranking targets for most websites
  - Consistent traffic potential
- **Low Volume (0-1,000)**: Niche or long-tail topics
  - Great for targeting specific customer questions
  - Lower competition, easier to rank
  - May have higher conversion rates due to specificity

**Data Sources**: You can gather this data from:
- Google Keyword Planner
- SEMrush, Ahrefs, or similar SEO tools
- Google Trends for trend analysis
- Your own site analytics for existing content performance

**Optional Field**: If you don't have access to keyword research tools, leave this blank and focus on Priority scoring.

#### Competition (0-100)

**Purpose**: SEO difficulty score indicating how challenging it would be to rank for this topic.

**How to Use**:
- **Low Competition (0-30)**: Easier ranking opportunities
  - New websites can compete effectively
  - Focus content creation efforts here first
  - Good for building domain authority
- **Medium Competition (31-70)**: Moderate difficulty
  - Requires quality content and some SEO optimization
  - Good targets for established websites
  - May need supporting content and internal linking
- **High Competition (71-100)**: Very challenging topics
  - Requires exceptional content, strong SEO, and time
  - Consider if you have unique expertise or angle
  - May be better as long-term goals

**Strategic Combinations**:
- **High Volume + Low Competition**: Ideal opportunities (rare but valuable)
- **Medium Volume + Low Competition**: Great targets for consistent growth
- **High Volume + High Competition**: Long-term goals requiring significant investment
- **Low Volume + Low Competition**: Good for niche authority building

**Content Strategy Impact**: Use competition scores to:
- Determine content depth and quality requirements
- Plan supporting content and internal linking strategies
- Set realistic ranking timeline expectations
- Allocate appropriate resources for content creation

### Using Metrics Together

**Example Topic Evaluation**:
```
Topic: "Best Email Marketing Tools for Small Business"
